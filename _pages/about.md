<!-- TODO -->
I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/), advised by Professor [Cliff Shaffer](https://website.cs.vt.edu/people/faculty/clifford-shaffer.html). My research lies at the intersection of Software Engineering and Computer Science Education, with focus on Equitable Grading Paractices, Parsons Problems and Tool Interoperability.

## Research Interests

**Equitable Grading Practices**
Studying grading systems and pracitces that promote fairness, transparency, and learning. Focusing on how they impact student motivation, engagement, and outcomes in large CS courses.

**Tool Interoperability**
Exploring interoperability among educational tools and platforms, with a focus on reducing instructor overhead and enabling scalable, data-informed teaching practices in computer science courses.

**Parsons Problems**
Using Parsons problems as a scaffolded assessment and learning tool, particularly how variations in structure and adaptivity can support novices and reduce cognitive load in programming education.

**Human/Student–LLM Interaction**
Investigating how students use generative AI tools in programming contexts, and how these tools can be integrated responsibly to support learning while preserving meaningful assessment.
