I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/), advised by Professor [Jin-Hee Cho](https://website.cs.vt.edu/people/faculty/jin-hee-cho.html). I am a member of the [Trustworthy Cyberspace Lab (tClab)](https://people.cs.vt.edu/~jicho/). My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, with a focus on reinforcement learning, large language models, and human-centered system design for online safety and security.

## Research Interests

**Goal-Directed Reinforcement Learning**
Designing reinforcement learning agents that achieve structured, goal-oriented behavior in complex and interactive environments.

**Modular LLM Guardrails and Safety**
Developing modular and audience-specific guardrails to guide large language model behavior and mitigate harmful or inappropriate outputs.

**Human–LLM Interaction**
Understanding and analyzing how people interact with and utilize LLM-based systems in real-world and educational contexts.

**AI for Cybersecurity Education**
Designing AI-driven approaches for online safety, including scam and cybergrooming prevention.
